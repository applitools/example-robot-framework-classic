# This config file specifies how to run visual tests with Applitools.
# It applies to all tests in this project.

# To connect visual test results to your account,
# you must set the `APPLITOOLS_API_KEY` environment variable to your Applitools API key.
# To find it: https://applitools.com/tutorials/getting-started/setting-up-your-environment.html
# If you don't explicitly set the API key here,
# then the SDK will automatically read the `APPLITOOLS_API_KEY` environment variable to fetch it.
